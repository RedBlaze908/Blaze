# Blaze Programming Language

### Beta 1.0.0
Possible input output, there are several bugs to start the code is not perfect we will see to fix them in the next version of the software.
DO NOT TOUCH THE .EXE FILES, you can move and use only the shortcut file (Blaze.exe the one with the icon) not anything else and do not start other exe's, if you start other exe's the application may not work properly anymore.

### IMPORTANT:
you must have gcc installed on the pc otherwise the program will not work (gcc is nothing but the c language).

I am aware that to output the code you have to press the "run" key 2 times.
In addition to write the input values you have to use the terminal that opens with the window and at the end when to loaded everything type the number (also here there is a bug so if at the first time it does not write resume the run key and then it will write, important do not press the space key or the enter key write what you have to write attached to what you way comes out in the terminal)

Features not available in this version:
-graphical system (window, buttons, text area ...)
-websites

### DOCUMENTATION

# MOST IMPORTANT:
this programming language will develop with time thanks to the help of the people who will use it, so for ideas of functions to add, bugs or whatever don't hesitate to leave an "Issues" with things to add or bug fix. alternatively there is also in my discord server the possibility to be able to write and talk about it (you can find the server invitation in my github profile page)

### Copyright
All language is copyrighted so taking, copying, passing off as your own the language without asking is strictly forbidden, for anything that implies this or wanting to do a project like incorporating my language somewhere ASK for permission.

if you liked the project ho interested you why not leave it a star? thank you to all who will <3

For the creation of app projects or any other stuff with it it is possible to do what you want as well as video inherent to it although as already said do not pass it off as your own
